## How to run locally

To run the dice game on your local machine, there are a few requirements.
* You will need a compiler with C++20 support (g++ preferred)
* You will almost certainly want to be on linux

In the root directory:

```bash
# runs npm install for each package
scripts/setup-dev-env

# creates a fresh set of keys
scripts/create-dev-keys

# builds and runs all of the services
npm start
```

The app should now be available at `http://localhost:3000`! If not, see the sections below for setting up individual services.

### Game Server
The game server manages all of the logic for game sessions. Since rooms are ephemeral, it does not use a database. It also sends achievement unlock info to the auth server.

Use `./game/run-server.sh` (linux only)
  - This will automatically recompile/restart the server any time you modify a source file

Alternatively, run `make && ./GameServer` in the `game` directory

**NOTE: If you are not running a local auth server, be sure to set `NO_AUTH=true`**

### Auth Server
The auth server is responsible for managing and authenticating users and user data. It uses a PostgreSQL database to store user data (achievements, stats, etc.)

- `cd auth/devdb; docker-compose up -d` to set up the database
- `cargo run` to run the service

### Client

Use `cd client; npm i; npm start`
  - Navigate to `localhost:3000`
  - This will also hot reload any time you modify a file in the client folder

### Terminal Client
To run the terminal client locally run
```bash
cd terminal-client
node client.js [--room wKvsbw]
```

To run the terminal client locally connecting to a local server run
```bash
cd terminal-client
node client.js --host localhost --port 3001 --insecure --room wKvsbw
```
